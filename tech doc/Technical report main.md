# AI-Powered Medical Scribes and MBS Billing Optimization in General Practice

## Introduction

General practice is grappling with increasing administrative burdens, from exhaustive note-taking to complex billing processes. Australian GPs, like many worldwide, face significant paperwork and billing compliance tasks that consume time and contribute to burnout. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential remedy. AI-powered *medical scribes* can automatically transcribe consultations and even suggest Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) billing items in real-time, aiming to streamline documentation and maximize legitimate billing. One example is *MBSPro*, an AI-driven scribe developed by a GP, which listens to consultations and highlights relevant Medicare item numbers as it drafts clinical notes based on the conversation. This means that if a consultation turns to asthma management, the system will prompt the doctor with related billable items (like spirometry or care plan codes), and even identify additional opportunities (for instance, flagging due vaccinations) that can turn a routine visit into a more comprehensive (and better reimbursed) encounter. Several such tools – from startup products like MBSPro and *MBS Helper* to solutions by larger providers like Telstra Health – are now being trialed to support GPs. This brief explores the need for these AI scribes, how they work, their benefits, and the considerations for their safe implementation in general practice.

## The Challenge: Documentation Overload and Missed Billings

Excessive paperwork and complicated billing rules have long plagued general practice. Surveys confirm what GPs know firsthand: administrative tasks are taking a toll. According to the RACGP's 2024 Health of the Nation report, 70% of Australian GPs are concerned about their heavy administrative workload (up from 60% the previous year). This paperwork burden not only impacts doctors' time but also has knock-on effects – some GPs report that *"red tape… audit threat, medico-legal risk [and] administrative burden"* are making general practice less appealing as a career, which ultimately *"results in less GPs and worse health outcomes for patients,"* as one doctor warned. A major component of this admin load is ensuring proper billing: Australia's Medicare system has hundreds of item codes with strict rules. Busy GPs often inadvertently underbill or avoid certain items, which can mean lost revenue and potential gaps in patient care.

In fact, several factors contribute to missed billing opportunities in daily practice:

- GPs may not bill for *all* the services they provide during a consult, especially when rushing through back-to-back appointments. Important details can be overlooked in documentation, leading to unclaimed Medicare items.
- MBS item numbers are **complex and frequently changing**, making them hard for practitioners to keep track of and apply correctly. The rules for combinations, exclusions, and prerequisites can be cumbersome to recall on the fly; some doctors admit they avoid the more convoluted billing scenarios for fear of making an error.
- There is often **no systematic mechanism** in place to ensure MBS compliance across all doctors in a clinic. Each GP is left to manage billing on their own, which can result in inconsistency and missed claims, especially in practices without dedicated billing auditors or tools.
- The *fear of audits and rejections* also leads to conservative billing. GPs may deliberately underbill or omit legitimate items if they are unsure about the rules, just to "be safe" and avoid potential penalties. This cautious approach, while understandable, means money is left on the table.

The cumulative impact of these issues is far from trivial. Even a modest underbilling – for example, an average of just $40 unclaimed per hour – adds up to roughly **$65,000 in lost revenue per GP per year**. Across an entire practice, that represents hundreds of thousands in income left uncollected annually. In addition, underbilling can correspond to under-servicing: patients might miss out on preventive care or additional services that were clinically indicated but not documented or billed. Clearly, there is both a financial and a patient-care incentive to capture all legitimate services provided. This is the context in which AI-powered scribe and billing assistant tools have entered the scene, promising to reduce the documentation burden and ensure opportunities for billing (and care) are not missed.

## AI Scribes and Billing Assistants: An Emerging Solution

**AI medical scribes** are software tools (often powered by machine learning and natural language processing) that can automatically generate clinical documentation from doctor-patient conversations. They essentially act as a "digital assistant" during the consult. Using speech recognition, an AI scribe can listen to the consultation (via a microphone or integrated telehealth system) and produce a draft of the encounter notes for the GP. More advanced systems go a step further: analyzing the content of the conversation to suggest appropriate MBS item codes that the doctor might bill for that consult.

MBSPro is one such system, developed "by GPs, for GPs," which prides itself as *Australia's leading AI-powered scribe & MBS billing platform*. It not only transcribes the consultation but highlights billable Medicare items relevant to the consultation context in real-time. For example, when a discussion during the consult indicates the patient has asthma, MBSPro might immediately flag MBS items for spirometry, asthma action plans, or a chronic disease management plan, as these are services the GP could consider providing and billing if appropriate. If during the same visit the patient also mentions needing routine care (e.g. immunisations), the system will remind the GP of those opportunities as well, ensuring that *"a simple consult for a puffer"* is recognized as an opportunity to update vaccines and perform a broader review – turning it into *"possibly $400 in billings"* (with corresponding additional care for the patient). Importantly, the intent is not to encourage unnecessary billing, but to help GPs deliver comprehensive care without missing out on reimbursements for work done. As MBSPro's founder Dr. Casey Going emphasizes, the platform is *"not just about GPs making money"* – it's also about ensuring patients receive all the care they're eligible for in a timely manner (for example, getting those vaccines up to date or having important health assessments done when due).

MBSPro isn't alone; a number of AI-driven documentation and billing aids have surfaced in Australia in the past year or two. Another such tool is **MBS Helper** (part of the *mAIscribe* platform), an AI-powered billing assistant for GPs. MBS Helper similarly aims to ensure doctors *"bill accurately, compliantly, and at the highest appropriate level – so you stop leaving money on the table."* It tackles the same pain points by using an intelligent algorithm to automate billing suggestions. According to its creators, this tool can help GPs *"instantly identify potential MBS items – no more guessing,"* ensure they *"bill at the highest legitimate level for every consult,"* *"avoid billing errors that trigger audits,"* and *"spend less time on admin and more time with patients."* These advertised capabilities closely mirror MBSPro's goals, underlining that the core proposition of such tools is twofold: reducing administrative effort and improving billing accuracy (with both financial and compliance benefits).

Even large healthcare IT providers are entering the arena. In early 2025, Telstra Health launched **Smart Scribe**, an AI voice recognition tool integrated into the popular MedicalDirector Clinical software used by many GP clinics. Smart Scribe focuses on automating documentation: it listens to the consultation and converts the conversation into a structured clinical note within the patient's electronic health record, essentially relieving the doctor from typing out the notes. Beyond notes, it can also automatically generate related documentation such as referral letters, patient summaries, and medical certificates, which the GP can then review and edit. This integration into the clinical software's workflow is key – doctors see the AI-drafted notes and suggested documents right in their system, and can accept or modify them as needed. While Telstra's Smart Scribe in its current form has been more about documentation and less about billing suggestions, it demonstrates the broad interest in applying AI to streamline clinical admin work. Notably, Telstra Health partnered with specialist AI providers (Heidi Health and Intellitek Health) to build this solution, indicating that a combination of speech-to-text technology and advanced language processing underpins these tools.

In summary, AI scribes and billing assistants are quickly becoming viable solutions in general practice. Multiple products – whether start-ups like MBSPro and MBS Helper or offerings from established companies – are being piloted to assist GPs. All these solutions share a common goal: **freeing doctors from the tedium of typing and coding, so they can focus on clinical care while ensuring they are properly reimbursed for their work.** The next sections delve into how these systems function and the tangible benefits they offer, as well as the challenges that need to be navigated for their safe adoption.

## How Do AI Scribe Systems Work?

AI scribe and billing systems integrate several technologies to assist GPs from the start of a consultation to its conclusion. At a high level, the process typically works as follows:

1. **Speech Recognition and Transcription:** The encounter begins with the doctor and patient talking as usual. Using a microphone (often the doctor's computer or a mobile device), the system continuously listens to the conversation. Advanced speech-to-text algorithms (often powered by AI models trained on medical speech) transcribe the spoken dialogue into text in real time or near-real time. This forms the basis of the consultation notes. For instance, Smart Scribe's voice recognition engine, built into MedicalDirector, captures the patient-doctor conversation and converts it into a draft clinical note without the GP needing to type.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Context Analysis:** Once the conversation is transcribed, the AI analyzes the text of the consultation to identify key elements: patient complaints, diagnoses discussed, treatments or investigations mentioned, etc. Using NLP techniques, it can interpret the medical context. For example, if the transcript mentions "asthma control has been poor" or "the patient is wheezing, we should do spirometry," the system infers that this consult involves asthma management and pulmonary function testing. This contextual understanding is crucial for the next step.

3. **MBS Knowledge Base and Item Suggestion:** The AI system cross-references the parsed consultation details against a knowledge base of Medicare item codes and rules. Essentially, it asks: "Given what happened in this consult, what are the relevant billable items?" This includes both *clinical* items (e.g. a specific procedure or care plan) and *administrative* items (e.g. a prolonged consultation code if the consult was long, or a case conference item, etc.). Modern systems like MBSPro and MBS Helper come pre-loaded with the MBS coding rules – including descriptions of over 100 common GP item numbers along with their billing criteria, restrictions, and allowed combinations. Because of this, the AI can match the consultation content to the appropriate codes and do so *intelligently*: it knows, for example, that certain items cannot be billed together on the same day, or that if item X is billed, item Y must have been performed and documented. MBSPro's **"MBS Planner"** feature exemplifies this, reportedly able to suggest "100+ MBS items during consults with restrictions, templates and billing combinations noted" – in other words, it doesn't just throw a code at you, but also indicates any relevant rules or documentation needed for compliance. Similarly, MBS Helper's algorithm will immediately present the doctor with the *suggested item numbers* for that consult, without the GP having to manually search the MBS schedule. All of this happens behind the scenes in seconds.

4. **Real-Time Feedback to the GP:** The suggestions and drafted notes are then presented to the doctor, typically via the interface of their clinical software or the scribe's own application window. The GP might see, for example, a drafted consultation note ready for editing, alongside a list of suggested Medicare item codes with explanations. MBSPro highlights items as the consult is ongoing, effectively acting like a prompt or reminder in the corner of the screen. Other systems might display suggestions right after the consult, before finalizing the billing. In either case, the doctor retains control – they review the AI's output. For documentation, the GP corrects any errors in the notes or adds any nuances the AI missed. For billing, the GP decides which suggested items were truly performed and justified, then selects those for billing. This human verification step is critical for safety and compliance: the AI assists, but the licensed practitioner makes the final call.

5. **Integration with Workflow:** A key aspect of these tools is integration into existing GP workflow and systems. For instance, MBSPro advertises integration with Best Practice (a major GP electronic health record system) – it can pull in the patient's **past billing history** and display it to the GP ("waiting room" feature), to ensure that no eligible chronic disease plans or health assessments are overlooked. This means if a patient is due for a care plan or hasn't had a health assessment that they qualify for, the system will flag it when the patient comes in. Similarly, some tools have *pre-consult* questionnaires for patients (e.g., MBSPro's *Pre-Consult Assistant*) where the patient can input their agenda or symptoms via a tablet in the waiting room; the AI then uses that info to pre-emptively highlight "relevant billing & preventative care opportunities" for the GP before they even start the consult. In terms of documentation integration, Telstra's Smart Scribe places the generated notes and letters right into MedicalDirector's interface for easy review. The best systems strive for a seamless experience: the GP doesn't have to significantly alter how they work or switch between many apps – the scribe is either built into their clinical software or connects through secure APIs.

6. **Secure Data Handling:** From a technical standpoint, these systems must handle sensitive patient data securely. Typically, the audio from the consultation and the generated text are processed either on encrypted cloud servers or locally, in compliance with health data privacy regulations. (MBSPro, for example, highlights its security and compliance measures elsewhere on its site.) Some products may use local processing for speech-to-text to alleviate privacy concerns, whereas others use cloud AI with strong encryption. Ensuring no unauthorized access or storage of patient recordings beyond their intended use is an important part of how these tools work, though details vary by provider.

In essence, AI scribes combine *speech recognition*, *language understanding*, and *expert knowledge of billing rules* to assist the GP at each step. By doing so, they automate what can be automated (typing up notes, looking up item codes) while leaving the clinical decisions and final validation to the human doctor. It's a synergy of human and machine: the AI handles routine clerical tasks and provides decision support, and the physician applies clinical judgment and oversight.

## Benefits of AI Scribes and Billing Assistants

When implemented well, AI-assisted scribing and billing offers a range of potential benefits for doctors, clinics, and patients alike. Early pilots and user reports have been promising, suggesting these tools can make a real impact on general practice operations. Key benefits include:

- **Time Savings and Productivity:** Perhaps the most immediately measurable benefit is the reduction in time spent on documentation. AI scribes can save several minutes per consultation by handling the bulk of note-taking. In a recent trial, Telstra Health reported that their Smart Scribe saved GPs an average of **5 minutes per patient consult**, which could translate to *"up to $40,000 per GP annually"* in time value (either seeing more patients or leaving work earlier). Cumulatively, this is a significant efficiency gain – for example, a GP seeing 30 patients a day might save over 2 hours of typing time. That time can potentially be reallocated to more patient-facing activities or simply reducing physician overtime. Over weeks and months, the workload reduction is substantial, addressing the top concern GPs have about excessive admin load.

- **Increased Billing and Revenue (for Legitimate Services):** By ensuring no billable service goes unnoticed, these tools can markedly boost practice revenue *ethically*. The AI's comprehensive suggestions help capture the full scope of work done. One analysis found that even modest underbilling can cost tens of thousands of dollars yearly per doctor – AI assistants help recoup that by highlighting everything the GP is entitled to bill. MBS Helper's creators note that their tool will *"suggest the most lucrative item or combination of items"* for a consult while remaining compliant, so that every service provided is captured. Real-world anecdotes back this up: MBSPro's usage showed how an consult that might have otherwise been billed as a simple 15-minute visit could legitimately be billed at a much higher level (e.g., including a care plan, spirometry, vaccinations) because the AI identified those needs during the consult. This is revenue the practice would have otherwise left on the table. Importantly, this is not about "upcoding" fraudulently – it's about not forgetting items that were actually done or could appropriately be done. Patients benefit too, as they receive more thorough care (for example, getting that asthma action plan or vaccination that might have been overlooked). In group practices, such improvements can translate to hundreds of thousands in additional annual revenue, improving the clinic's financial sustainability in an era of tight Medicare rebates.

- **Improved Accuracy and Compliance:** AI systems are meticulous and consistent in applying rules, which can actually improve compliance with MBS requirements and reduce errors. They cross-check against Medicare rules instantly – something a busy GP might not have time to do for every consult. By suggesting *legitimate* item combinations and warning about incompatible ones, they help avoid billing mistakes that could trigger audits or Medicare rejections. For instance, MBS Helper explicitly advertises that it helps GPs *"avoid billing errors that trigger audits and rejections,"* and that its co-billing suggestions are *"optimised for compliance and maximum reimbursement."* Having an ever-watchful digital assistant means fewer accidental breaches of billing rules (e.g., billing two items together that shouldn't be, or missing a required documentation element). Over time, this could also translate to fewer hassles with Medicare or the Professional Services Review, and greater confidence among practitioners that they are "doing it right." Some systems also ensure the *documentation* supports the billing – for example, by automatically structuring the notes so that each issue is documented in a way that justifies the corresponding item code. This alignment of notes and bills can further protect against audits.

- **Reduced Administrative Burden and Burnout:** By offloading routine tasks like typing up notes or searching for item codes, AI scribes let doctors focus on the clinical interaction. Doctors often report that typing and paperwork are a major source of fatigue. With an AI handling much of it, GPs can experience less cognitive load. As one GP director involved in an AI scribe deployment put it, *"Smart Scribe not only saves time but also improves the accuracy and efficiency of our practice, ultimately allowing us to focus more on delivering quality patient care."* This encapsulates a critical benefit: physicians get to spend more of the consult looking at the patient, having a conversation, rather than staring at a screen and keyboard. They can be more present, which improves the patient experience and the doctor's job satisfaction. In the long run, alleviating administrative drudgery can help reduce burnout and keep doctors in the workforce. It's telling that 61% of GPs surveyed believed that innovation could help streamline administrative functions in practice – AI scribes are exactly the kind of innovation many have been waiting for. 

- **Enhanced Patient Care and Preventive Health:** Counterintuitive as it may sound, focusing on billing opportunities can actually improve patient care when done right. These AI systems often highlight *care gaps* – for example, if a patient with diabetes hasn't had a care plan or a foot exam billed recently, the system reminds the GP, prompting them to address it. MBSPro's ability to flag preventative health opportunities (like health assessments or vaccinations due) means patients are more likely to receive comprehensive care in each visit. Also, by saving time on writing notes, doctors can devote a bit more time to listening to patients or counseling them during the consult, improving care quality. Some AI suggestions might encourage doctors to perform beneficial services they otherwise might skip due to time (e.g., doing a quick mental health screen and claiming a mental health care plan item if appropriate, which benefits the patient with extra support). Thus, when aligned with clinical needs, maximizing billing *coincides with* maximizing care.

- **Support for Training and Consistency:** Especially for newer GPs or GP registrars, having an AI assistant can serve as a safety net and learning tool. It consistently applies the extensive MBS rules, effectively teaching by example. Over time, doctors may become more familiar with items simply by seeing the AI suggest them. It can also standardize billing practices across a clinic – ensuring all doctors, not just the experienced ones, are billing uniformly and correctly for similar services. This consistency is good for practice management and fairness. As one GP user testimonial of MBS Helper noted, the tool *"helps me remember to add item numbers – such as the ECG and COVID consult numbers that I frequently forget. It also makes a good assessment of when a mental health consult number might be appropriate."* In this way, the AI can be like a second pair of eyes, reinforcing best practices and thorough care.

In sum, early deployments of AI scribes in Australian general practice have shown concrete benefits: significant time saved per consult, more complete billing of services rendered, reduced stress over admin tasks, and even potential enhancements to patient care delivery. If these tools continue to mature, they could play a pivotal role in making general practice more efficient and financially sustainable, while allowing GPs to do what they do best – care for patients.

## Risks and Considerations

While AI-powered scribes and billing aids are promising, it is critical to approach their use with careful consideration. Both the medical community and professional bodies like the RACGP have highlighted potential pitfalls and the need for safeguards when adopting AI in clinical practice. Here we outline some of the key challenges and considerations:

- **Accuracy and Clinical Reliability:** AI systems are not infallible. They may generate notes or suggestions that *appear* very confident but are partially incorrect or irrelevant – a phenomenon sometimes called "AI hallucination" when applied to language models. As the RACGP warns, *"conversational AI tools can provide responses that appear authoritative but on review are vague, misleading, or even incorrect."* In the context of an AI scribe, this could mean a note that misinterprets a symptom, or a suggested billing item that doesn't quite fit the consult. If a GP were to trust the AI output blindly, it could lead to clinical errors or billing mistakes. Furthermore, AI models carry the biases present in their training data. If the underlying algorithms weren't trained on diverse, representative clinical scenarios, they might underperform or make biased suggestions for certain patient groups (e.g., failing to suggest appropriate care for underrepresented populations, or conversely, over-suggesting services in a way that doesn't align with patient needs). Therefore, **human oversight is essential** – GPs must review and correct AI-generated content. In a very real sense, the doctor remains responsible for what is documented and billed. The technology is a tool, not an arbiter of truth, and it will occasionally be wrong.

- **Patient Privacy and Data Security:** By design, these systems handle sensitive patient data – including potentially recording the entire consultation (audio) and processing it into text. This raises privacy concerns. Leaks or misuse of such data could be extremely serious. There's also the issue of inputting patient information into third-party AI services: *"do not input sensitive or identifying data,"* the RACGP resource advises clinicians, unless you are sure of how it's stored and used. Practices must ensure that any AI scribe they use complies with all privacy laws (such as Australia's Privacy Act and health records regulations). Data should be encrypted in transit and at rest. If cloud-based, the servers ideally should be in Australia or in jurisdictions with strong data protection. Additionally, informed patient consent is a factor – patients should be made aware (at least via clinic privacy policies, if not explicitly each time) that an AI will be involved in documenting their consult. In its new guidance, the RACGP suggests that *"GPs should involve patients in the decision to use AI tools and obtain informed patient consent when using patient-facing AI tools."* Though an AI scribe working in the background might not be obvious to a patient, transparency fosters trust. Clinics may consider updating their consent forms or notices to mention AI assistance in documentation.

- **Professional and Legal Responsibilities:** Even when using AI, the GP is legally and professionally the one responsible for the clinical record and the billing submitted. Thus, any errors the AI makes could have ramifications for the doctor. If an AI suggested an inappropriate billing code and it was submitted, the doctor would have to justify it in an audit. Regulators have made it clear that *use of an AI tool does not absolve a practitioner of duty of care*. In fact, the RACGP explicitly states that GPs must ensure use of AI *"complies with relevant legislation and regulations, as well as any practice policies and professional indemnity insurance requirements"*. Doctors should verify whether their medical defense/indemnity covers incidents involving AI tools and follow any conditions set by insurers. Moreover, if an AI system provides any sort of clinical decision support (even something as minor as suggesting a treatment or investigation), it might be considered a medical device. The guidance notes that AI tools *designed specifically for medical use* are preferable, and if they make diagnostic or treatment recommendations, they *"should be TGA-registered as medical devices"*. Billing suggestions likely don't count as diagnostic/treatment advice, but any tool that blurs that line should have regulatory clearance. From an ethics standpoint, GPs should also be cautious not to over-rely on the AI – it's there to assist, but the physician's judgment must remain paramount.

- **User Training and Adoption Hurdles:** Introducing AI in a clinical setting isn't as simple as installing software. There is a learning curve for doctors and staff. GPs need to be trained on how to use the scribe effectively and safely – for instance, how to correct it, how to prompt it if needed, and understanding its limitations. The RACGP recommends that before using conversational AI in practice, GPs get trained on *"the risks and limitations of the tool, and how and where data is stored,"* among other things. At present, awareness and familiarity with these tools is still low. Surveys show that over **80% of GPs are not very familiar with specific AI tools** available, and only a tiny fraction (around 3%) have actually used AI-based administrative tools in practice. This means there may be initial resistance or slow uptake due to skepticism or simply lack of exposure. GPs who are not tech-savvy might find it intimidating to have an AI "listening in" or might not trust its output. To realize the potential of these tools, efforts must be made to educate and train doctors (and also practice managers, nurses, etc.) on their proper use. Early adopters often report positive experiences, but scaling that to the majority will take time and demonstration of value. Change management is as important as the technology itself in this scenario.

- **Workflow Integration and Technical Issues:** If the AI scribe doesn't integrate smoothly with the clinic's existing systems, it could add *more* work instead of less. For example, if a scribe tool requires lengthy editing or if it outputs notes in a format that doesn't match the clinic's records system, doctors might get frustrated. Technical glitches like inaccurate voice transcription, lag in real-time suggestions, or system crashes during a consult can also hamper trust in the tool. Clinics need to ensure they have the necessary hardware (high-quality microphones, reliable internet, etc.) and that the AI tool has been configured correctly for their environment. There should also be a clear fallback: if the AI fails or is down, the GP can revert to the usual process without chaos. Essentially, the introduction of the AI should not disrupt clinical flow; it should enhance it. Part of this is also setting appropriate expectations – initially, doctors might need to correct the AI a fair bit as it learns (some systems adapt to an individual doctor's speech patterns and habits over time). As long as they expect this and see it improve, it can be acceptable. But if expectations are overhyped (e.g., "it will write your notes perfectly from day one!"), disappointment could sour the adoption.

- **Ethical Considerations and Patient Perception:** There is an ethical dimension to using AI in clinical encounters. Some patients might feel uneasy knowing an AI is involved in their care, even indirectly. It's important to communicate that the AI is a tool under the doctor's control, not a decision-maker. Additionally, GPs should be wary of over-reliance. For instance, if an AI consistently suggests a set of additional services to increase billings, the clinician must ensure those services are genuinely appropriate for the patient and not let financial incentives skew clinical judgment. The **doctor-patient relationship** should remain front and center. As Dr. Rob Hosking (Chair of RACGP's tech committee) noted, *"AI will never replace the important role of the doctor-patient relationship."* The patient's trust in their GP relies on the sense that the GP is listening and personally invested in their care – if the use of AI detracts from that (for example, if the GP is distracted by checking AI prompts on a screen, or if patients sense the doctor is following an AI's suggestions unthinkingly), it could undermine trust. Thus, maintaining a patient-centered approach is vital: the AI should augment the consultation, not interfere with the human connection.

Finally, the RACGP's guidance on AI in general practice (July 2025) is worth underscoring: the college welcomes the technology's potential but urges caution. They state that while conversational AI and scribes *"could revolutionise parts of healthcare delivery,"* GPs should be *"extremely careful"* at this stage and fully aware of issues like patient safety, privacy, and data security. Many questions remain unanswered in real-world use of AI for healthcare, and the onus is on clinicians to implement these tools responsibly. In summary, **due diligence, robust training, and strict oversight** are necessary when bringing AI scribes into medical practice. With these measures, the benefits can be reaped while minimising risks.

## Conclusion

AI-powered medical scribes and billing assistants represent a significant innovation for general practice, addressing long-standing challenges of administrative overload and underbilling. Early experiences in Australia have demonstrated clear benefits – saving doctors' time, improving billing completeness and revenue, reducing documentation fatigue, and even enhancing patient care by ensuring important tasks aren't overlooked. In an environment where GP burnout and clinic viability are real concerns, such efficiency gains and revenue optimisations are timely. As one GP user succinctly noted, these tools *"ensure your practice can thrive — without extra admin work."* The technology is rapidly advancing, and we can expect AI assistants to become increasingly adept and integrated in day-to-day clinical workflows.

However, successful adoption of AI scribes will depend on balancing innovation with prudence. These tools should be seen as *assistants* rather than replacements for a doctor's own judgment and expertise. GPs must remain vigilant, double-checking the AI's outputs and maintaining ultimate responsibility for patient care and billing decisions. Professional guidelines, like the RACGP's resource on AI, provide a useful roadmap – emphasizing patient consent, data security, understanding the tool's limitations, and not using AI beyond its competence. When used within these guardrails, AI scribes can be a powerful ally to the healthcare team.

Looking ahead, as familiarity grows and the technology improves, we may see wider acceptance. It's conceivable that in a few years, having an AI scribe or billing assistant in a GP clinic will be as routine as having practice management software – an everyday tool that quietly boosts productivity and quality. The ultimate promise is a shift in how doctors spend their time: less on screens and paperwork, more on direct patient interaction. In a future where the **"digital assistant"** handles the clerical grind, GPs can focus on the human elements of care that no AI can replicate – empathizing, reasoning holistically, and making nuanced clinical decisions. In that sense, these AI tools, if carefully implemented, could **restore the art of medicine** by freeing clinicians from some of the artifice of administration. As with any new technology, challenges remain, but the path forward is one of cautious optimism: leveraging AI's capabilities to enhance healthcare delivery while steadfastly guarding the trust, safety, and personal connection at the heart of the doctor-patient relationship.
